## dotfilez
heres some of my dotfiles, refactored to be a bit more generic. maybe you'll find something useful?

### stuff i use
* [llm-familiar](https://github.com/illbloo/llm-familiar) - all the LLM stuff
* [argc](https://github.com/sigoden/argc) - bash cli framework
* [nb](https://github.com/xwmx/nb) - note-taking (like CLI Obsidian)
